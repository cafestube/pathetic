 * A PathFilter is a functional interface that allows customization of the pathfinding process

 * <p>In essence, a PathFilter acts as a whitelist for blocks during the pathfinding process. It
 * evaluates each potential block (or node) on the path and determines whether it is valid or not
 * based on the implemented filter logic. Only the blocks that pass the filter are considered valid
 * and included in the final path.
